# Simultaneous Timing Attacks
1. Create two resource pools in burp suite (Settings > Project > Tasks > New Resource Pool > Set Max Concurrent Requests = 1
2. Create your intruder request
  2.1. Set one of them with a HTTP header `X-OffTempo-Pool: A`
  2.1. Set one of them with a HTTP header `X-OffTempo-Pool: B`
3. Start attack for both of the intruder requests
4. Go to Offtempo tab and just wait, click Run after enough samples collected

## **Statistical timing side-channel analysis for Burp Suite.**

OffTempo is a Burp Suite extension that captures HTTP response timing data from Intruder attacks and performs statistical analysis to detect timing-based side channels. It compares two pools of requests and tells you whether the observed latency differences are meaningful or just noise.

Useful for detecting:
- Resource enumeration via response time differentials
- Timing-based blind SQL injection
- Password / authentication timing attacks
- Any scenario where server-side branching leaks through response latency

The primary metric is **AUC (Area Under the Curve) via Mann–Whitney U** - intuitively, the probability that a random observation from a set of requests exceeds one from another set. Additional statistics (Cohen's *d*, p-value, standard deviation, p95/p99) are provided for deeper analysis.

## Installation

### Prebuilt JAR (recommended)

1. Download the latest `offtempo.jar` from the [Releases](https://github.com/anvilventures/offtempo/releases) page
2. In Burp Suite, go to **Extensions → Installed → Add**
3. Set **Extension type: Java** and load the JAR

### Build from source

Requires Java 17+ and Gradle.

```
git clone https://github.com/anvilventures/offtempo.git
cd offtempo
./gradlew bigJar
```

The JAR is generated under `build/libs/`. Load it into Burp Suite as above.

## Usage


1.  **Enable capture**: Toggle timing capture on in the OffTempo tab

2.   **Fill Pool A**: Set up an Intruder attack for your first class of requests (e.g. a known *existing* resource) and run it. Timing data flows into Pool A automatically. Aim for at least 30–50 requests per pool to reduce the impact of network jitter and get statistically reliable results.

3.   **Switch to Pool B**: Select Pool B in OffTempo, then run a second Intruder attack for your other class of requests (e.g. a known *non-existing* resource).

4.  **Run analysis**: Click **Run**. OffTempo computes the AUC score, plots both distributions, and outputs statistical metrics.
